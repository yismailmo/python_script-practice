#Day1:

Write a program to avoid repitiion in list.

mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]
mylist = sorted(set(mylist))
print(mylist)

Day 2
Write a Python program to find a list of integers with exactly two occurrences of nineteen and at least three occurrences of five.
def test(nums):
    return nums.count(19) == 2 and nums.count(5) >= 3
nums = [19,19,15,5,3,5,5,2]


print("Check two occurrences of nineteen and at least three occurrences of five in the said list:")
print(test(nums))

Day 3:

Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. 

#Temperature degree and unit is taken into temp and unit respectively
temp = int(input("Enter temperature value: "))
unit = input("Enter temperature unit whether celsius or fahrenheit: ")
unit = unit.strip() #"Strip" method to get rid of extra side spaces in case user enters any with entering unit

#Conditional structures to decide based on unit given the appropriate formula to use
if any([unit.lower()=="celsius", unit.lower()=="c"]): #Code block executes if stated unit is Celsius
    F = ((9*temp)/5) + 32
    print( str(temp)+"°C", "is", int(F), "in Fahrenheit")
elif any([unit.lower()=="fahrenheit", unit.lower()=="f"]): #Code block executes if stated unit is Fahrenheit
    C = (5*temp - 160)/9
    print( str(temp)+"°F", "is", int(C), "in Celsius")
else: print("Values or Unit given is invalid!!") #Displays an invalid error message to user upon deviation from accepted values


Day 4
Write a Python program to test a list of one hundred integers between 0 and 999, which all differ by ten from one another. Return true or false. 


def test(li):
    return all(n in range(1000) and abs(n - i) >= 10
               for n in li for i in li if n != i) and len(set(li)) == 100
nums = list(range(0, 1000, 10))
print("Check whether the said list contains one hundred integers between 0 and 999 which all differ by ten from one another:")

print(nums)

Day 5

Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.
 # solution 1
 def biggest(x,y,z):
    if x>=y and x>=z:
        print(x)
    elif y>x and y>z:
        print(y)
    else:
        print(z)
        
 # solution 2
def maximum(a, b, c):
    list = [a, b, c]
    return max(list)
  
# Driven code 
a = 10
b = 14
c = 12
print(maximum(a, b, c))        

Day 6
Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list.
# solution 1
# list of numbers
list1 = [10, 21, 4, 45, 66, 93]
 
# iterating each number in list
for num in list1:
    # checking condition
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num, end=" ")
       
# solution 2
# list of numbers
list1 = [10, 21, 4, 45, 66, 93]
 
# using list comprehension
even_nums = [num for num in list1 if num % 2 == 0]
 
print("Even numbers in the list: ", even_nums)

# Convert number to reversed array of digits
Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.
def digitize(n):
    return [int(x) for x in str(n)[::-1]]
Or
def digitize(n):
    return map(int, str(n)[::-1])
