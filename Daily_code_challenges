#Day1:
Day2
Write a program to avoid repitiion in list.

mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]
mylist = sorted(set(mylist))
print(mylist)

Day 2
Write a Python program to find a list of integers with exactly two occurrences of nineteen and at least three occurrences of five.
def test(nums):
    return nums.count(19) == 2 and nums.count(5) >= 3
nums = [19,19,15,5,3,5,5,2]


print("Check two occurrences of nineteen and at least three occurrences of five in the said list:")
print(test(nums))




Day 3
Write a Python program to test a list of one hundred integers between 0 and 999, which all differ by ten from one another. Return true or false. 


def test(li):
    return all(n in range(1000) and abs(n - i) >= 10
               for n in li for i in li if n != i) and len(set(li)) == 100
nums = list(range(0, 1000, 10))
print("Check whether the said list contains one hundred integers between 0 and 999 which all differ by ten from one another:")

print(nums)
